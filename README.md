# Creating StarDict markup for the Turkish-Kyrgyz Dictionary by Gulzura Jumakunova  

This is a project on marking up or as it is also said annotation of printed dictionary source.
Annotation of Cumakunova's Turkish-Kyrgyz dictionary is intended to be performed due to TEI standards
First we get .doc file from any kind of source file, e.g AdobeAcrobats OCR engines xml or doc output, 
then we find and mark up each dictionary entry by specific tags introduced by StarDictTextualFile format then transform it to TEI schema.
