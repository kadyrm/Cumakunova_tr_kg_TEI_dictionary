# Creating StarDict markup for the Turkish-Kyrgyz Dictionary by Gulzura Jumakunova  

This is a project on marking up of printed dictionary text.
Annotation of Cumakunova's Turkish-Kyrgyz dictionary is intended to be performed according to StarDict TextualFile Schema. 
First we get .doc file from any kind of source file, e.g AdobeAcrobats OCR engines xml or doc output, 
then we process the doc file in VBA (VisualBasic for Application) programming environment to markup each dictionary entry by specific tags defined in StarDictTextualFile XML schema.
